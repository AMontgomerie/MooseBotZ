- copied over old 2014 moosebot code
- switched race to Z
- fixed bug causing only 1 larvae to be morphed at a time
- fixed bug meaning larvae couldn't be morphed when there was a morphing hatchery
- created getAllLarvae() method which returns a pool of all idle larvae so they can be spent easily
- fixed bug causing only 1 zergling from each pair to be added to army
- removed overlords from regroup commands because they are really slow and were causing attacks to be delayed
- added check to base count vs enemy base count to prevent over expanding
	- additional bases are now produced as macro hatcheries
	- will need a fix if switch back to T/P to prevent random nexus/cc spamming

plans:
- introduce more micro
- fix build order search bugs
- add muta harass

bugs:
- build order search hangs up if told to find a BO including anything except mutas or hydras
