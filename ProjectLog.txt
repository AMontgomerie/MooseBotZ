ideas:

build order generation:
- take current larvae pool into account when determining build order goals
	- if we dont have enough army + larvae to defend, then add sunkens
- take enemy army position into account
	- estimate time till attack, if its soon then try to make lots of lings rather than something slow
- opponent modelling
	- based on what we know we can predict enemy workers/income/army sizes
	- compare this information to our current status to determine actions
	- are we behind in economy? build more drones and get agressive
	- are we ahead in economy? get defensive

counter attacking:
- early game as Z is a lot about map control
	- just playing reactive leads to low drone count
- get ling speed and set up counter attack
	- either forces base trade or buys time for more defense
- set up special counter attack force of lings
	- seperate from main army
	- waits outside enemy base and attacks when they move out
