- copied over old 2014 moosebot code
- switched race to Z
- fixed bug causing only 1 larvae to be morphed at a time
- fixed bug meaning larvae couldn't be morphed when there was a morphing hatchery
- created getAllLarvae() method which returns a pool of all idle larvae so they can be spent easily
- fixed bug causing only 1 zergling from each pair to be added to army
- removed overlords from regroup commands because they are really slow and were causing attacks to be delayed
- added check to base count vs enemy base count to prevent over expanding
	- additional bases are now produced as macro hatcheries
	- will need a fix if switch back to T/P to prevent random nexus/cc spamming

plans:
- introduce more micro
- fix build order search bugs
- add muta harass

bugs:
- build order search hangs up if told to find a BO including anything except mutas or hydras

25/01/2015
- removed buildordersearch
- removed strategy manager
- added buildordergenerator
	- takes build order goal inputs and turns a vector of executable metatypes
	- calculates supply required and adds additional overlords
	- takes required buildings into account and constructs ones we dont have
	- checks if we dont have required lair/hive and adds one to queue if needed
- created new strategy manager
	- provides build order goals
		- has a set of ideal game states
		- compares current state to the next ideal state
		- build anything that is missing from the ideal state

plans:
- introduce a way to modify goals depending on the situation
	- e.g. dont make loads of drones if enemy is coming to attack
	- change type of unit being made depending on the point in the game which we are at

26/01/2015

- seperated mutas from main army so they can harass and not retreat when army retreats
	- still very crude, needs work
- added check for threats (if enemy units are closer to my base than their base)
	- when a threat is present, ai will stop making drones and make extra units and static D
	- when there is no threat, ai will make more drones and less units
- unit composition goals now scale with tech
	- will go ling > muta/ling > ultra/ling

bugs:
- makes 2 hives
- gets stuck regrouping for ages
- muta micro is a mess
- lings dont always retreat/regroup to the correct place
- overlord behaviour is a bit random
- making too many hatcheries at 1 base and walling in
	- should take more expansions even vs 1 base opponent
- building placement
	- need to make sure we dont build things in stupid places
	- sunkens at at-risk bases
	- no massive walls of macro hatches
	- no tech buildings at the front

extra improvements
- add ability to get important upgrades outside of scripted build order
	- e.g. when in midgame state, build evos and get 1/1 or something

08/02/15
- turned off seperate muta control and added them back to main army temporarily while dealing with other issues
	- //mutas.insert(unit); @ ArmyManager::addUnit();
	- // mainArmy.erase(unit);@ ArmyManager::removeUnit();
- turned it back on
- fixed building placement so tech buildings are always added to main and defensive structures to the closest base to enemy base

- muta micro needs to be changed so mutas continue towards attackposition but make detours to avoid enemy units

09/02/15
- simplified/improved muta micro so that mutas mostly stay out of range of enemies and attack when no nearby enemies
