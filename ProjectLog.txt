- copied over old 2014 moosebot code
- switched race to Z
- fixed bug causing only 1 larvae to be morphed at a time
- fixed bug meaning larvae couldn't be morphed when there was a morphing hatchery
- created getAllLarvae() method which returns a pool of all idle larvae so they can be spent easily
- fixed bug causing only 1 zergling from each pair to be added to army
- removed overlords from regroup commands because they are really slow and were causing attacks to be delayed
- added check to base count vs enemy base count to prevent over expanding
	- additional bases are now produced as macro hatcheries
	- will need a fix if switch back to T/P to prevent random nexus/cc spamming

plans:
- introduce more micro
- fix build order search bugs
- add muta harass

bugs:
- build order search hangs up if told to find a BO including anything except mutas or hydras

- removed buildordersearch
- removed strategy manager
- added buildordergenerator
	- takes build order goal inputs and turns a vector of executable metatypes
	- calculates supply required and adds additional overlords
	- takes required buildings into account and constructs ones we dont have
	- checks if we dont have required lair/hive and adds one to queue if needed
- created new strategy manager
	- provides build order goals
		- has a set of ideal game states
		- compares current state to the next ideal state
		- build anything that is missing from the ideal state

plans:
- introduce a way to modify goals depending on the situation
	- e.g. dont make loads of drones if enemy is coming to attack
	- change type of unit being made depending on the point in the game which we are at
